### ReadHeaderBlock 
  Should properly balance headers between processes -> Fast enough for now
### Implement proper Hilbert index
  current implementation is functions, but need to find method to query indexes

### Update reading process to insert reference to the point's source file
	
## TODO	

### MergeSort
  Implement mergesort into the reading phase 
	
### Rtree based on indexes -> 50% Complete
	
### Read point files based on area and clip point -> DONE
