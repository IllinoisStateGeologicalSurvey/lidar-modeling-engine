# BUGS
### ReadHeaderBlock 
  Should properly balance headers between processes
### Implement proper Hilbert index
  current implementation is causing a few errors around edges, need further investigation

### PointWrite
  Should properly write files based on header id(may need to reorg datasets)


### Update reading process to insert reference to the point's source file

## TODO

### MergeSort
  Implement mergesort into the reading phase

### Rtree based on indexes

### Read point files based on area and clip point
